# Hoe to integrate Google Maps into your Website

Go to [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/?hl=de) Platform and get a Maps Javascript API the Platform will guide you through the process and you will need a Google Account.

It will be free only for the first Year / thats what my Account says in 2019.

Your location you will find on [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/) this you have to add to your js code like I did and thats it.

You can improve with the zoom in the code like you need it.
